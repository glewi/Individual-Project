# Individual-Project
This project was completed as a requirement for the MCOMP Computer Science degree at the University of South Wales.  Please note that the project is a visual studio solution, and if you wish to change the TinySVG files, see the JSON intermediate representation or access the HPGL output you must navigate to the Bin folder in the project files.

To use the TinySVG test file provided, build the project, then navigate to the bin folder where the executable is located.  Finally drop the file in that folder and run the program.  You should see two files get created, the IR.JSON and output.HPGL file.  You can then examine these files to see what the progam has done.

When edititng the test file make sure you leave the TinySVG attributes in the same place as they are now, athough you can change the values of these attributes, do not rearrange them or this will break the program.
